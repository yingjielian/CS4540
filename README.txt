In this assignment, the starter code is basically empty because you'll be creating the Rails application from scratch.  A couple of points to make sure the grader-bot can find your code:

* Be sure you're in this file's directory when you generate your Rails application.
* Call your Rails app 'ksl_watcher_v2'
* This will create subdirectory in your repository called ksl_watcher_v2 and the code will all be in there.


Part of the assignment involves creating a home page with some canned content.  You can find the majority of that content in the sample_code_for_home_index_html_erb file in this directory.  You can copy/paste the contents of that file into your app's app/view/home/index.html.erb file.  (That file won't exist until you've generated the controller and views for Home.)  Note the comments in that file -- you'll need to insert your own code in several spots.
