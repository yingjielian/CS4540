I implemented a html style font and text in my web_server.rb class.

In order to see it, you will need to first run the class, you will need to type
"ruby run_web_server.rb" on your command line and go to chrome broswer type
"localhost:1234". It may take several times to see the results.

Finally, you will see the background changed and my wonderful text!
