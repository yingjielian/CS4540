            This service will keep an eye on the KSL Classifieds for you and alert you when a new listing of interest appears.
            Using this system means:
            <ul>
              <li>More free time -- no longer do you need to visit KSL regularly to check for that unopened BeeGees vinyl record you've been pining after</li>
              <li>ewer lost opportunities -- don't lose out to someone who's spending all their time scanning the KSL site while you do real work in the real world</li>
            </ul>  
        </div>
        <div class='nice-box'>
